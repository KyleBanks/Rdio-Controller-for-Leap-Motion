Rdio Controller for Leap Motion
===============================

A gesture based Rdio controller built for the Leap Motion, allowing you to play/pause, skip tracks, and change the volume through gestures.

The app is written in Objective-C and uses the Leap Motion C++ SDK.

For the time being, the GUI portion of the app (status bar icon) does nothing. All inputs are controller through the following gestures:

- **Swipe Up:** Increase the volume.
- **Swipe Down:** Decrease the volume.
- **Swipe Left:** Skip to previous track.
- **Swipe Right:** Skip to next track.
- **Swipe Forwards (Toward Screen):** Toggle play/pause.
